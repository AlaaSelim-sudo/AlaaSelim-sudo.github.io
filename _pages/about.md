I am a **postdoctoral researcher at Dartmouth’s Thayer School of Engineering** working at the intersection of **cyber-physical systems, smart grids, and AI/ML**. My research focuses on secure and resilient operation of **inverter-dominated distribution networks and microgrids**, with emphasis on **control, cybersecurity, and digital twins** for critical energy infrastructures.

I earned my **Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Connecticut** under supervision of Prof. Junbo Zhao, where I developed models and controllers that combine **reinforcement learning, model-predictive control, and physics-informed machine learning** to manage smart grids under uncertainty, disturbances, and cyber-attacks. I have built and used **cyber-physical testbeds** that couple **RTDS, OpenDSS, Schweitzer RTAC, SDN, and HIL platforms** to study microgrid operation, protection, and security under realistic communication constraints. I also held a **research affiliation and Higher Degree Research (HDR) appointment with the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia**, where I worked on **battery energy storage system (BESS) modeling and control**, including day-ahead scheduling, optimal operation, and grid-interactive performance.
 

Before joining the PhD program, I worked as an **Application Design Engineer at Schneider Electric**, designing and commissioning **SCADA and automation systems for power plants and critical infrastructure** using Schneider and AVEVA tools. This experience keeps my research grounded in real-world constraints on protection, communications, and control, and informs my work on **deployable, industry-relevant solutions**.

I am also an **entrepreneur and co-founder of an early-stage startup** focused on **intelligent energy management and battery optimization** for homes and small businesses. Through an **NSF-supported entrepreneurship program at UConn**, I led customer discovery interviews, developed hardware–software prototypes using microcontrollers, sensors, and NVIDIA Jetson platforms, and validated **AI-driven scheduling strategies** that combine user comfort with grid-friendly operation.

Teaching and mentoring are central to my career. I have served as a **Teaching Assistant and project co-supervisor at UConn and Ain Shams University**, taught labs in engineering foundations, power electronics, and modeling of PV systems, and delivered **industrial training in control automation and SCADA**. I enjoy designing project-based, hands-on learning experiences that help students connect theory to real systems.
