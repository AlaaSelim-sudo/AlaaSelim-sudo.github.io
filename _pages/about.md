I am **Dr. Alaa Selim**, a postdoctoral researcher at the *Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College*, working at the intersection of  
<span class="badge bg-primary mb-1">power systems</span>
<span class="badge bg-info text-dark mb-1">battery energy storage</span>
<span class="badge bg-success mb-1">deep reinforcement learning</span>
and  
<span class="badge bg-warning text-dark mb-1">cyber-physical security</span>.  
My research focuses on inverter-dominated distribution networks, grid-forming converters, and resilient control for DER-rich power systems.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at **UNSW Canberra**, and held research and teaching roles at the **University of Connecticut (UConn)**, where I worked on DRL-based Volt-VAR optimization, restoration control, and cyber-attack detection for active distribution networks.

### 🚀 Startup & industry

I am co-founder of **OptiEnerX / CogniDER AI**, building AI-driven tools for:

- **Smart BESS scheduling** under dynamic tariffs  
- **Cyber-resilient SCADA and DER monitoring**  
- **Digital twins and testbeds** for microgrids and inverter-dominated feeders  

Before academia, I spent several years in industry as an **automation and SCADA engineer** at **Schneider Electric**, designing control solutions for **power plants, refineries, and data centers**. I worked end-to-end from field I/O and communication protocols, through historians and analytics, up to high-level operator dashboards and automatic control logic.

### 🎓 Teaching & community

I enjoy mentoring students and engineers in:

- Power system analysis and control  
- Distributed energy resources and inverters  
- Machine learning, DRL, and optimization for energy  

I have been active in **IEEE PES/PELS** and various student leadership roles, organizing technical events, mentoring student teams, and supporting broader energy and sustainability communities.
